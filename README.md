## Introduction
The introduction section of the article provides an overview of the challenges associated with image uploads in web applications and explains how Cloudinary and BullMQ can help solve these challenges.

## Prerequisites
This section outlines the prerequisites for following the tutorial, including knowledge of Node.js and npm, and having Cloudinary and Redis set up.


## Running the Application

## Installation
Before getting started with the code, you need to install the project's dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages and libraries to run the project successfully.

## Getting Started with the Code
You can get started with the code by reviewing the files and directories in the project. The main application code can be found in the `src/` directory.

## Build and Run the Project
To build and run the project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup your .env**: Create a file name `.env`, check the `.env.sample` to know how this file looks like.

1. **Build the Project**: Run the following command to build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will compile the source code and create the necessary output files in the `dist/` directory.

2. **Run the Project**: After the project is built, you can start the application by running:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the Node.js application. Use Postman to test your routes
